# user-api-demo

Clone the repository and run `composer install`

Then create the database and migrate the schema
```
php bin/console doctrine:database:create
php bin/console doctrine:migrations:diff
php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```
The API requires an admin user to make most of the requests, which can be added manually through, for example, SQLiteStudio. 
Note:
  the email field should be a valid email *(e.g. test@test.com)*
  the roles should be a valid json string *(e.g. ["ROLE_ADMIN"])* 
  the password field requires a hashed string, which can be generated by running
```
php bin/console security:hash-password
```
Now you're free to try out the application locally with `symfony serve`
